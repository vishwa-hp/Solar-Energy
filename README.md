# Home Energy Dashboard

This project is a React-based solution for visualizing energy data for a home. It enables homeowners to determine the status of energy resources within their home, such as solar panels, battery backup, electric vehicles, and power meters.

## Features

- Display energy data for different resources: solar panels, battery backup, electric vehicles, and power meters.
- Fetch energy data from a JSON-based schema representing each energy resource.
- Dynamically render energy data on the front-end using React components.

## Components

- `App.js`: The main component that fetches energy data and renders the energy resources.
- `EnergyDisplay.js`: Component to display energy data for each resource.

- ## Live Demo
